            The current hiring and referral process is fundamentally flawed. Candidates face a barrage of
            applications, navigate thousands of websites, endure ghosting, and suffer from poor management.
            This results in a slow, painful experience for everyone involved.

            We are revolutionizing this process by creating a seamless, delightful referral experience. With
            just one click, we bring back the magic of referrals, transforming them into a swift and enjoyable

          <h2 className="font-bold">How do I come to this Idea?</h2>
          <p className="font-sans font-semibold">
            During my final year of bachelor’s, I stumbled upon the transformative power of job referrals and
            was truly amazed. It struck me that securing a referral from within a company could significantly
            enhance one’s interview prospects. However, I soon realized that obtaining referrals wasn’t as
            simple as it seemed. It involved tirelessly scouring through various social platforms to connect
            with employees and team members, enduring instances of being ghosted or receiving delayed
            responses, and encountering other obstacles. Driven to tackle this challenge head-on, I embarked
            on a mission to create a solution. This journey ultimately led me to establish refhired.com
