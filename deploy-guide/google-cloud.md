# Deploy services to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Will update soon with detailed steps and instructions........

<!-- ## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud account
- Google Cloud SDK installed
- A project created in Google Cloud Console

## Steps to deploy services

1. **Set up Google Cloud SDK**:
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK if you haven't already.
   - Authenticate your account using `gcloud auth login`.
   - Set your project using `gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]`.
2. **Create a Compute Engine instance**:
   - Navigate to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Go to Compute Engine > VM instances.
   - Click "Create Instance".
   - Choose your desired machine type, region, and zone.
   - Configure the firewall rules to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
   - Click "Create" to launch the instance.
3. **SSH into your instance**:
   - Use the command `gcloud compute ssh [INSTANCE_NAME] --zone [ZONE]` to connect to your instance.
4. **Install necessary software**:
   - Update the package list: `sudo apt-get update`.
   - Install Docker: `sudo apt-get install docker.io`.
   - Start Docker service: `sudo systemctl start docker`.
   - Optionally, add your user to the Docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`.
5. **Deploy your application**:
   - Clone your application repository or copy your application files to the instance.
   - If using Docker, build your Docker image: `docker build -t [IMAGE_NAME] .`.
   - Run your Docker container: `docker run -d -p 80:80 [IMAGE_NAME]`.
6. **Set up a static IP (optional)**:
   - Go to VPC Network > External IP addresses in the Google Cloud Console.
   - Reserve a new static IP address.
   - Assign this static IP to your VM instance.
7. **Configure domain name (optional)**:
   - If you have a domain, go to your domain registrar and set the A record to point to your static IP address.
   - In Google Cloud Console, go to Cloud DNS and create a new DNS zone if needed.
   - Add an A record for your domain pointing to the static IP address of your VM instance.
8. **Monitor and manage your application**:
   - Use Google Cloud Console to monitor your VM instance and application performance.
   - Set up logging and monitoring using Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring services.
   - Regularly update your application and instance for security and performance improvements.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with SSH, ensure that your firewall rules allow SSH traffic (port 22).
- If your application is not accessible, check the firewall rules to ensure that HTTP/HTTPS traffic is allowed.
- If you face issues with Docker, ensure that the Docker service is running and that your user has the necessary permissions.

## Conclusion

Deploying services on Google Cloud Platform can be straightforward with the right setup. By following the steps outlined above, you can successfully deploy and manage your applications on GCP. Always ensure to keep your services updated and monitor their performance for optimal results.
